This is gonna be real ASM documentation, not Medium-blog cosplay.
I’m mapping RiskSignal → Bug Bounty recon → ASM core, end-to-end.
No pricing. No VC fluff. Just how attackers think, how defenders win.

I’ll break this into 6 hard sections so your brain doesn’t segfault.

1️⃣ RiskSignal → Bug Bounty Recon Workflow (Direct Mapping)

Bug bounty recon is basically manual ASM done by cracked humans.

You’re automating that mindset.

Traditional BB Recon Flow (human)
Root domain
→ subdomains
→ IPs
→ ports
→ services
→ misconfigs
→ exposure
→ report

RiskSignal ASM Flow (automated)
Org Anchor
→ Asset Graph
→ Exposure Taxonomy
→ Risk Drift
→ Attack Paths
→ Analyst Decision

Mapping table (important)
Bug Bounty Step	RiskSignal Module
Amass / Subfinder	Passive Asset Discovery
Masscan / Naabu	Active Exposure Scan
Nmap banners	Deep Intel Engine
Manual pattern spotting	Exposure Taxonomy
“This looks bad”	Attack Path Heuristics
Notes.txt	Temporal Asset Memory

👉 RiskSignal becomes a recon teammate, not a scanner.

2️⃣ ASM Core Data Model (Schemas That Actually Make Sense)

Forget “tables for IPs.”
ASM needs relationships.

🔷 Core Entities
organization
id
name
confidence_score
first_seen
last_updated

asset

(abstract parent)

id
org_id
asset_type (domain | ip | service | cert | api)
first_seen
last_seen
ownership_confidence

domain
asset_id
fqdn
root_domain
is_subdomain

ip
asset_id
ip
asn
country
is_cloud

service
asset_id
ip_asset_id
port
protocol
product
version
banner_hash

certificate
asset_id
fingerprint
issuer
san_list
expiry

exposure

(this is where money lives)

id
asset_id
taxonomy_id
severity
confidence
first_seen
last_seen

scan_event
id
asset_id
scan_type (passive | active)
diff_summary
timestamp

3️⃣ Exposure Taxonomy (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Stop thinking “CVE-based.”
Attackers don’t care about CVEs — they care about reachability + trust failure.

🔥 Exposure Classes (Base Layer)
A. Network Exposure

Dangerous open ports

Legacy protocols

Admin panels exposed

B. Application Exposure

Auth-less endpoints

Debug interfaces

API schema leaks

C. Identity & Trust

Weak SPF / DMARC

Self-signed certs

Expired cert reuse

D. Infrastructure Hygiene

Dev/staging exposed

Orphaned cloud assets

Forgotten subdomains

E. Behavioral Risk

Malicious subnet proximity

Infra churn (IP changes often)

ASN reputation decay

🧠 Example Taxonomy Entry
ID: EXP-NET-9200
Name: Public Elasticsearch
Severity: High
Confidence: High
Attackability: Immediate
Category: Network Exposure


This lets you say:

“We don’t just see risk — we classify it.”

4️⃣ Active vs Passive Intel Sources (What to Add & Why)

You already have a good mix. Here’s how to expand without becoming noisy.

🟢 Passive Sources (Low Risk, High Signal)

Use these continuously.

Certificate Transparency logs

RDAP / ASN metadata

DNS historical records

Header fingerprinting

TLS handshake metadata

👉 Passive feeds = asset discovery backbone

🔴 Active Sources (Controlled, Tactical)

Use these selectively.

Beacon port probes (22, 80, 443, 8080)

Protocol-specific handshakes

Auth-header presence checks

API schema sniffing (OPTIONS)

Rule:

Active scans only when ownership confidence ≥ threshold

🧩 Hybrid Intelligence (Your secret weapon)

Combine:

Passive discovery

Active confirmation

Temporal memory

This reduces:

false positives

customer freak-outs

legal headaches

5️⃣ Attack Path Modeling (This Is Advanced ASM)

This is where RiskSignal becomes next-gen.

You’re not exploiting — you’re showing how an attacker would think.

🔗 Attack Path = Graph

Nodes:

Asset

Exposure

Trust Boundary

Edges:

“Leads to”

“Shares trust with”

“Co-located with”

Example Attack Path
dev.api.foo.com
→ no auth
→ internal admin endpoint
→ prod database IP


You display this as:

visual chain

severity escalates per hop

confidence decays per hop

This is 🔥 for:

SOCs

IR teams

Bug bounty triage

6️⃣ Remediation Workflow (WITHOUT becoming Jira)

You’re not a ticketing system.
But you guide action.

Exposure Lifecycle
Detected
→ Confirmed
→ Acknowledged
→ Mitigated
→ Regressed (if reappears)


Each exposure shows:

what changed

why it’s risky

what usually fixes it

how often it reappears globally

No hand-holding.
Just intelligence with context.

7️⃣ How Bug Hunters Will Use RiskSignal (Real Talk)

A hunter will:

Input root domain

See forgotten assets

Spot risky exposure class

Manually validate

Submit cleaner reports faster

That’s ethical force multiplication.

You’re not replacing hunters.
You’re making them deadlier.

Final Reality Check (No Sugar)

This is not small.
This is not easy.
But it’s correctly scoped.

Most ASM tools:

start compliance-first

end boring

die quietly

RiskSignal starts:

attacker-first

temporal-aware

exposure-driven

That’s why it works.
